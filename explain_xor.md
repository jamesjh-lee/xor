# XOR
XOR(Exclusive OR) gate is a digital logic gate that gives a true output when the number of true inputs is odd.

| A | B | A XOR B |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

# Nonlinear model for XOR
Basically to solve XOR problem, it is essential that nonlinaerity and many of layers are core in a DNN model.
Let's assume that a DNN model has two layer and nonlinear activation function.
The DNN model is as below the figure.
